## Project Description
  The purpose of this project is to understand any recurring tredns within the national Portuguese consumer bank. I hope by looking at the average, median and standard deviation that I will see any interest trend or outlier during the days between March 2nd to April 27th. By looking at this time frame of a little over a month the data will help a better conclusiom on what is happening in the consumer bank. # Tlab2
